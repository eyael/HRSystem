1, Appointments are not removing the existing appointment anymore...

2, I don't want to see all appointments in the index after I made appointments.

3, Doctors view, Patient view and Admin view should different be based on the login's role.

4, I want to add the user email adress in the appointment controller when I make an appointment so that instead of getting every email it goes directly to people who made the appointments.
